<h1>Intro</h1>

<p>Stackoverflow Finder is a quick and easy way to answer any basic programming questions anyone may have.</p>

<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Problem Description</h3>

<p>Forget syntax?  Just starting a language?  Our site is perfect for you. Instead of having to sift through websites to find the answer to your specific question, just ask us and we will prompt you with the answer right away.</p>

<a id="creating-pages-manually" class="anchor" href="#creating-pages-manually" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How it works!</h3>
<p>To solve this problem I used a basic AI approach - the Hill climb algorithm. This algorithm uses a score function to return a good result.  Not necessarily the best result, but one deemed well enough from the system. </p>

<p>The site uses a number of tools to score the right answer and bring it right to you.  After asking a question we use Natural Language Processing to determine what's important about your questions. We then parse all tags related to the question; Such as languages, data-structures, and algorithms.  We then query stackoverflow for all related answers.  Based on that, we score all the given answers on a number of features; Including word occurances in the title and body, arragment of the words in order, if the answer contains code, tags occurences in the title and body, as well as the length of the answer.  After these answers are all scored, the most relevant answer is returned.</p>

<p>Click on the link above to go to the finder website. - From there the system is simple. Just type in your full question. (Make sure to use correct spelling and full words.)  We will them prompt you with the found answer.. <br> <br> If you feel like helping us out, you can let us know how well our answer worked for you.  There is a submit button at the bottom of the page that will query the question, and if you liked the answer.  Then just click Back To Start, and repeat. :)</p>

<a id="support-or-contact" class="anchor" href="#support-or-contact" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Future Plans</h3>

<p>When building this system I found it difficult to match programming synonyms, because they arent necessarily actual synonyms.  A search for "how to create a list" could show up as "how to initialize a list" or "how to make a list". As you can see create, make, and initialize aren't synonyms.  To solve this problem I've built a custom dictionary for all programming synonyms.  In the future I plan to collect more data on this, and just keep improving my dictionary.   </p>
